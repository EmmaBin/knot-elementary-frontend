## Inspiration

We were inspired by our teammate Emma's experience as an elementary school teacher and how this app or the existence of something like it may have simplified her life. Also, two of our members (Mike and Akshita) are currently at university and our personal experiences flowed through the entire project. With such a strong background in academia (a shared experience), we were able to **pull** this project from ideation to fruition.

## What it does

Welcome to Knot-Elementary, the ultimate tool for managing your child's academic life with ease. With our platform, you can authorize different roles to ensure that every stakeholder is on the same page. Our meeting scheduling feature makes it simple to coordinate parent-teacher conferences, while our view child grades option lets you monitor your child's academic performance in real-time. With admin access, you can easily manage your child's academic records and make updates as needed. Plus, our read/write feature allows you to communicate with teachers and school administrators directly from the platform. Sign up for Knot-Elementary today and take part in your child's academic journey!

After getting authenticated, our database determines your role (either **admin**, **teacher**, or **parent**). Each user role starts somewhere different and has permission granted and revoked.

## 🛠️ How we built it 🛠️

➡️We built the front end with **React⚛️** and React-specific dependencies, such as __Flowbite-react__, __react-helmet__,  __bootstrap-react__,  __react-icons__, and __React-router__ / __react-router-dom__.

➡️The styling was done with **Tailwind CSS🌊** and **CSS3🟦**. The backend was done with **PostgreSQL🐘** and **Express🔙☕📜**. 

➡️We used **Auth-0⬛⭐** for authentication and hosted the project with **Render**.

## 😵‍💫 Challenges we ran into 😓

__Auth0__ Integration, routing, design, time-zone conflicts. Slight version control, as we decided to push all our personal changes to one repository branch was not wise, so we either forked, cloned, or made our contribution on our own personal testing environments. Hooray for 🌟**version control**!🎊

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The database took some thought, and after careful deliberation. The database was able to encompass most of our needs. The design also took some thought and consideration, the group decision was absolute for each topic on the agenda.

## What we learned 📚

Collectively, we had new experiences. The main knowledge that was being taught was **UI/UX design🖌️🖼️**, edge cases, **Tailwind CSS🌊**, component attributes, **authentication🔒🔑**, routing⛰️, and version control👾.

## What's Next for Knot-Elementary

We hope that we either work on this project individually, in groups, or together (again), as the ideas are there. But, with the time constraints that a hackathon ensues it proved to be rather difficult.
